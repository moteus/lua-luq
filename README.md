Light userdata queue

This library aimed to be low level basis to build pools of shared objects.
For now it implement only queues with fixed capacity but I have plan to implement
shared objects.

For examples see [lzmq-pool](https://github.com/moteus/lzmq-pool) and [odbc-pool](https://github.com/moteus/lua-odbc-pool).
